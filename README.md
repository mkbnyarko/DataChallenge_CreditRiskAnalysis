# 🏦 Credit Risk Analysis

## Blossom Academy 2024 Data Fair – Data Challenge (1st Place Solution) 🏆

### 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a credit risk analysis solution developed for the Blossom Academy 2024 Data Fair Data Challenge. The objective of the challenge was to analyze customer credit data and build a robust model capable of predicting credit risk to support better lending decisions.

Our team developed an end-to-end data science solution—from data exploration and feature engineering to modeling and evaluation—which ultimately won 1st place in the competition.

### 🏆 Achievement
🥇 1st Prize Winner
Blossom Academy 2024 Data Fair – Data Challenge

### 🎯 Problem Statement
Financial institutions face significant losses due to loan defaults. The goal of this challenge was to:
- Analyze historical customer data
- Identify key risk indicators
- Build a predictive model to classify customers by credit risk
- Provide actionable insights to improve credit decision-making

### 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this challenge included customer demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes relevant to creditworthiness.
Key characteristics:
- Structured tabular data
- Mixture of numerical and categorical variables
- Presence of missing values and class imbalance

*The dataset was provided exclusively for the competition.*

### 📈 Results
What truly set our solution apart from other competitors was our **deep, intentional approach to data understanding and preprocessing**.

Rather than rushing into modeling, we invested significant time in exploratory data analysis, carefully questioning **each feature, its meaning, and its contribution** to the model’s predictions. We evaluated features not just statistically, but also through the lens of domain knowledge, ensuring that interpretations aligned with real-world credit risk behavior.

Key factors that contributed to our winning solution include:
- Thorough data exploration to uncover patterns, inconsistencies, and hidden relationships
- Careful preprocessing, including thoughtful handling of missing values and noisy features
- Explicit treatment of class imbalance, which significantly improved model reliability and fairness
- Feature-level scrutiny, assessing how each variable influenced model output and business interpretation
- Model selection driven by problem context, choosing algorithms well-suited for credit risk classification
